  If I reload VSCode via `Developer: Reload Window` (or fully restart the debugging session),
  then the error diagnostics will be correctly calculated, but do not update/go away when I
  fix the errors (and newly introduced errors do not show up).

  Perhaps there is some TS Plugin caching issue with associated files?
